### DSC 241: Statistical Models (Winter 2023)
*Graduate course, Teaching assistant*

DSC 241 is a graduate course that covers statistical learning techniques, focusing on how to perform analysis with a computer and interpreting results based on the backing theory. Topics include: multiple regression; diagnostics (checking assumptions and looking for outliers); polynomial regression and other ways to enrich a model; robust regression methods; penalized regression for high-dimensional models; generalized linear models to allow for a categorical response (classification); and a short overview of other regression methods such as classification trees, random forests, boosting, and neural networks from a statistical point of view.

### DSC 291： Large-Scale Statistical Analysis (Spring 2022)
*Graduate course, Teaching assistant*

DSC 291 is a graduate course on statistical analysis of high-dimensional data, focusing on large-scale multiple hypothesis testing and inference. Topics include: Family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) control and estimation, empirical null distribution, empirical Bayes methods, smooth Gaussian random fields.

### FMPH 221： Biostatistical Methods I (Fall 2021)
*Graduate course, Teaching assistant*

FMPH 221 is an introductory graduate course on applied statistical data analysis. Topics include: model interpretation, model assumptions, confounding, interactions, testing of coefficients and ANOVA, adjusting for multiple comparisons, heteroscedasticity, model diagnostics, variable selection, prediction 
error and inference, cross-validation and resampling via the bootstrap. 

### FMPH 102： Biostatistics in Public Health (Fall 2019)
*Undergraduate course, Teaching assistant*

FMPH 102 is an introductory undergraduate course on the fundamentals of Biostatistics,. Topics include: methods summarizing and displaying data; probability; statistical distributions; central limit theorem, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing; methods for comparing means of continuous variables between two groups; methods for comparing proportions between two groups; simple and multiple linear regression.
