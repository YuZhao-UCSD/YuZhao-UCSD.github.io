I am PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of California, San Diego. I am studying under the supervision of [Professor Armin Schwartzman](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/armin.schwartzman) on random field theory (RFT) based peak detection, and [Professor Steven Edland](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/steven.edland) on longitudinal data modeling. My research interests mainly lie in random field theory, longitudinal data analysis, and causal inference. 

Beyond my school work and research, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in statistics and data science. I enjoy using data to tell compelling stories, and making rational scientific judgments based on effective analysis. Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my experience.
